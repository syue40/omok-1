DO YOU LOVE CONNECT 4? HAVE YOU PLAYED MAPLESTORY? WELL THEN YOU'LL LOVE OMOK

I wanted to use this project to learn more about drawing grids in preparation for an algorithm project. 
This is an old game I used to play with my mom. It's played on a traditional Go mat. The goal is to be the first to connect 5.

Some strategies and tips:
- When a player achieves 3 in a row, the other player MUST block. If the player has achieved 4 in a row with no blocking pieces on either side it's a definite win.
- Try to dupe the opponent by setting up situations where they cannot see attacking directions: I found that setting up an X with the pieces works great.

TO DO:
- add a restart/surrender button so players can restart the match (currently only 1 game can be played)
- add a score tracker to keep score of how many games each player has won
